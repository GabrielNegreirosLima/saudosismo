This repo aims to remember the dark, golden, and glorious times of 2013, my first year of Network Computers Technician in CEFET-MG. In this age I was below average of the first programming class and I had to do a recuperation homework, _ the famous and  fearful 1.12 exercises of Harry Farrer's book_. I was pretty sad and I remember thinking I would never be able to program in my life. Here I am, trying to not write awful codes but happy that I really did the list, and didn't have to repeat the entire class year of 2013. Thank u for reading until here :')
